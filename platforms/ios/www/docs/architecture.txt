this doc describes the basic architecture of this project.

this is the basic structure of an SPA app that can be ran as phonegapapp.
it can also run in browser, but some optimizations need to be made (like loading of the js files, templates and so on)

the folder structure:

* css - the css files

* docs - the docs

* img - any images used in css, js

* js - the js source code, described below

* l10n - contains any localization files
this aspect is mostly ignored in the beginnig, making it harder to offer multiple languages later on, so we make sure that from beginning these are consideres

* templates - contains all the templates for generating the screens and controls
by default the underscore templating engine is used, the reasons for that are:
- the syntax is very simple and similar to ejs, rails and php
- the performance is quite good

we have provided an optimizied plugin for the underscore template engine.

The JS folder

this has the following structure:

* components - are any reusable parts that have both logic and ui

* config - the config files

* controllers - the code that implements the business logic of the app.
the entry points are routes and events

* helpers - any support code for the app

* lib - 3rd parties libraries or any extensions to them

* modules - code for standalone functionality, like code for geo processing, validators and so on

* service - is the service layer of the app, the code that interacts with an api on the server or any other libraries.
this is where all the ajax calls should be contained

* the ui - contains all the code that deals with the generations and ui interaction.
these components are called from the controllers. but they do not call the controller.
they might generated events/messages that are treated in controllers

app.js - the starting point of the app
